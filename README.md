This CRAN Task View contains a list of packages useful for sports
analytics, grouped by sport.

Besides these packages, a very wide variety of functions suitable for
empirical work in Finance is provided by both the basic R system (and
its set of recommended core packages), and a number of other packages on
the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Consequently, several of the
other CRAN Task Views may contain suitable packages, in particular the
[Econometrics](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/Econometrics.html),
[Multivariate](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/Multivariate.html),
[Optimization](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/Optimization.html),
[Robust](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/Robust.html),
[SocialSciences](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/SocialSciences.html)
and [TimeSeries](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/TimeSeries.html) Task
Views.

Contributions are always welcome, and encouraged. Since the start of
this CRAN task view in April 2005, most contributions have arrived as
email suggestions. The source file for this particular task view file
now also reside in a GitHub repository (see below) so that pull requests
are also possible.

**Standard regression models**

-   A detailed overview of the available regression methodologies is
    provided by the
    [Econometrics](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/Econometrics.html)
    task view. This is complemented by the
    [Robust](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/Robust.html) which
    focuses on more robust and resistant methods.
-   Linear models such as ordinary least squares (OLS) can be estimated
    by `lm()` (from by the stats package contained in the basic R
    distribution). Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation can be undertaken
    with the standard `optim()` function. Many other suitable methods
    are listed in the
    [Optimization](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/Optimization.html)
    view. Non-linear least squares can be estimated with the `nls()`
    function, as well as with `nlme()` from the
    [nlme](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/nlme/index.html) package.
-   For the linear model, a variety of regression diagnostic tests are
    provided by the [car](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/car/index.html),
